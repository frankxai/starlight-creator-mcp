# Security model

The MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Antigravity, Codex) is the principal. The substrate trusts it for *content* but never hands it credentials, never executes shell built from inputs, and never publishes without a human-entered code.

## Credentials
- Resolution order: environment variable → OS keychain (`@napi-rs/keyring`: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Secret Service) → AES-256-GCM file under `~/.creator-mcp/` (headless fallback, key in `vault.key` 0600 or `CREATOR_VAULT_KEY`).
- Keys are sent only to their provider, in headers (never URL query strings). Logs go to stderr and pass through a redactor that knows every vault value plus common key shapes.
- The MCP tool surface has no "set key" tool. Keys enter via `creator-mcp setup` or the client's own config/MCPB `user_config`.

## Network
- Every outbound request goes through `guardedFetch`: http(s) only, host allowlist (provider hosts + `policy.allowHosts`), private/link-local/loopback ranges blocked (including DNS results), redirects re-checked, size and time limits. Provider result URLs are fetched only when returned by a provider for a job we created.
- `import_url` must be on the allowlist; `CREATOR_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=1` exists for tests only.
- The optional HTTP transport binds to 127.0.0.1, validates Host/Origin for localhost, and is stateless per request (no shared in-process state between sessions).

## Filesystem
- Writes are confined by `resolveInside()`: no absolute paths, no `..`, no UNC, symlink escape checked. Roots: `~/.creator-mcp`, the configured assets directory, the `init` target.
- No shell strings. `rclone` is invoked with `execFile` and an argument array.

## Publishing
- `creator_publication_prepare` computes a canonical payload hash; `creator_publication_approve` requires the human to type the first 8 characters of that hash through an elicitation form (or the `creator-mcp approve` terminal command). The manifest is then HMAC-SHA256 signed with a key that lives in the vault.
- `creator_publish` verifies signature, expiry (≤ 14 days), recomputed hash and asset bytes before sending; channel sends are idempotent by `sha256(payload_hash | channel | adapter)`; a per-adapter hourly limit is enforced locally.
- Numerical claims without an evidence asset are marked `blocked` and surfaced as warnings.

## Licenses
- Polar keys are validated from the user's machine against the public customer-portal endpoint. Offline use is allowed for 14 days after a *successful online* validation of the same key fingerprint; the cache is MAC-signed so editing it does not unlock anything. There are no length or prefix heuristics.

## Reporting
Open a private security advisory on GitHub or email the maintainer listed in `package.json`.
